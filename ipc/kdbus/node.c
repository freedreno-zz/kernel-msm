/**
 * DOC: kdbus nodes
 *
 * Nodes unify lifetime management across exposed kdbus objects and provide a
 * hierarchy. Each kdbus object, that might be exposed to user-space, has a
 * kdbus_node object embedded and is linked into the hierarchy. Each node can
 * have any number (0-n) of child nodes linked. Each child retains a reference
 * to its parent node. For root-nodes, the parent is NULL.
 *
 * Each node object goes through a bunch of states during it's lifetime:
 *     * NEW
 *       * LINKED    (can be skipped by NEW->FREED transition)
 *         * ACTIVE  (can be skipped by LINKED->INACTIVE transition)
 *       * INACTIVE
 *       * DRAINED
 *     * FREED
 *
 * Each node is allocated by the caller and initialized via kdbus_node_init().
 * This never fails and sets the object into state NEW. From now on, ref-counts
 * on the node manage its lifetime. During init, the ref-count is set to 1. Once
 * it drops to 0, the node goes to state FREED and the node->free_cb() callback
 * is called to deallocate any memory.
 *
 * After initializing a node, you usually link it into the hierarchy. You need
 * to provide a parent node and a name. The node will be linked as child to the
 * parent and a globally unique ID is assigned to the child. The name of the
 * child must be unique for all children of this parent. Otherwise, linking the
 * child will fail with -EEXIST.
 * Note that the child is not marked active, yet. Admittedly, it prevents any
 * other node from being linked with the same name (thus, it reserves that
 * name), but any child-lookup (via name or unique ID) will never return this
 * child unless it has been marked active.
 *
 * Once successfully linked, you can use kdbus_node_activate() to activate a
 * child. This will mark the child active. This state can be skipped by directly
 * deactivating the child via kdbus_node_deactivate() (see below).
 * By activating a child, you enable any lookups on this child to succeed from
 * now on. Furthermore, any code that got its hands on a reference to the node,
 * can from now on "acquire" the node.
 *
 *     Active References (or: 'acquiring' and 'releasing' a node)
 *     Additionally to normal object references, nodes support something we call
 *     "active references". An active reference can be acquired via
 *     kdbus_node_acquire() and released via kdbus_node_release(). A caller
 *     _must_ own a normal object reference whenever calling those functions.
 *     Unlike object references, acquiring an active reference can fail (by
 *     returning 'false' from kdbus_node_acquire()). An active reference can
 *     only be acquired if the node is marked active. If it is not marked
 *     active, yet, or if it was already deactivated, no more active references
 *     can be acquired, ever!
 *     Active references are used to track tasks working on a node. Whenever a
 *     task enters kernel-space to perform an action on a node, it acquires an
 *     active reference, performs the action and releases the reference again.
 *     While holding an active reference, the node is guaranteed to stay active.
 *     If the node is deactivated in parallel, the node is marked as
 *     deactivated, then we wait for all active references to be dropped, before
 *     we finally proceed with any cleanups. That is, if you hold an active
 *     reference to a node, any resources that are bound to the "active" state
 *     are guaranteed to stay accessible until you release your reference.
 *
 *     Active-references are very similar to rw-locks, where acquiring a node is
 *     equal to try-read-lock and releasing to read-unlock. Deactivating a node
 *     means write-lock and never releasing it again.
 *     Unlike rw-locks, the 'active reference' concept is more versatile and
 *     avoids unusual rw-lock usage (never releasing a write-lock..).
 *
 *     It is safe to acquire multiple active-references recursively. But you
 *     need to check the return value of kdbus_node_acquire() on _each_ call. It
 *     may stop granting references at _any_ time.
 *
 *     You're free to perform any operations you want while holding an active
 *     reference, except sleeping for an indefinite period. Sleeping for a fixed
 *     amount of time is fine, but you usually should not wait on wait-queues
 *     without a timeout.
 *     For example, if you wait for I/O to happen, you should gather all data
 *     and schedule the I/O operation, then release your active reference and
 *     wait for it to complete. Then try to acquire a new reference. If it
 *     fails, perform any cleanup (the node is now dead). Otherwise, you can
 *     finish your operation.
 *
 * All nodes can be deactivated via kdbus_node_deactivate() at any time. You can
 * call this multiple times, even in parallel or on nodes that were never
 * linked, and it will just work. The only restriction is, you must not hold an
 * active reference when calling kdbus_node_deactivate().
 * By deactivating a node, it is immediately marked inactive. Then, we wait for
 * all active references to be released (called 'draining' the node). This
 * shouldn't take very long as we don't perform long-lasting operations while
 * holding an active reference. Note that once the node is marked inactive, no
 * new active references can be acquired.
 * Once all active references are dropped, the node is considered 'drained'. Now
 * kdbus_node_deactivate() is called on each child of the node before we
 * continue deactvating our node. That is, once all children are entirely
 * deactivated, we call ->release_cb() of our node. ->release_cb() can release
 * any resources on that node which are bound to the "active" state of a node.
 * When done, we unlink the node from its parent rb-tree, mark it as
 * 'released' and return.
 * If kdbus_node_deactivate() is called multiple times (even in parallel), all
 * but one caller will just wait until the node is fully deactivated. That is,
 * one random caller of kdbus_node_deactivate() is selected to call
 * ->release_cb() and cleanup the node. Only once all this is done, all other
 * callers will return from kdbus_node_deactivate(). That is, it doesn't matter
 * whether you're the selected caller or not, it will only return after
 * everything is fully done.
 *
 * When a node is activated, we acquire a normal object reference to the node.
 * This reference is dropped after deactivation is fully done (and only iff the
 * node really was activated). This allows callers to link+activate a child node
 * and then drop all refs. The node will be deactivated together with the
 * parent, and then be freed when this reference is dropped.
 *
 * Currently, nodes provide a bunch of resources that external code can use
 * directly. This includes:
 *
 *     * node->waitq: Each node has its own wait-queue that is used to manage
 *                    the 'active' state. When a node is deactivated, we wait on
 *                    this queue until all active refs are dropped. Analogously,
 *                    when you release an active reference on a deactivated
 *                    node, and the active ref-count drops to 0, we wake up a
 *                    single thread on this queue. Furthermore, once the
 *                    ->release_cb() callback finished, we wake up all waiters.
 *                    The node-owner is free to re-use this wait-queue for other
 *                    purposes. As node-management uses this queue only during
 *                    deactivation, it is usually totally fine to re-use the
 *                    queue for other, preferably low-overhead, use-cases.
 *
 *     * node->type: This field defines the type of the owner of this node. It
 *                   must be set during node initialization and must remain
 *                   constant. The node management never looks at this value,
 *                   but external users might use to gain access to the owner
 *                   object of a node.
 *                   It is totally up to the owner of the node to define what
 *                   their type means. Usually it means you can access the
 *                   parent structure via container_of(), as long as you hold an
 *                   active reference to the node.
 *
 *     * node->free_cb:    callback after all references are dropped
 *       node->release_cb: callback during node deactivation
 *                         These fields must be set by the node owner during
 *                         node initialization. They must remain constant. If
 *                         NULL, they're skipped.
 *
 *     * node->mode: filesystem access modes
 *       node->uid:  filesystem owner uid
 *       node->gid:  filesystem owner gid
 *                   These fields must be set by the node owner during node
 *                   initialization. They must remain constant and may be
 *                   accessed by other callers to properly initialize
 *                   filesystem nodes.
 *
 *     * node->id: This is an unsigned 32bit integer allocated by an IDA. It is
 *                 always kept as small as possible during allocation and is
 *                 globally unique across all nodes allocated by this module. 0
 *                 is reserved as "not assigned" and is the default.
 *                 The ID is assigned during kdbus_node_link() and is kept until
 *                 the object is freed. Thus, the ID surpasses the active
 *                 lifetime of a node. As long as you hold an object reference
 *                 to a node (and the node was linked once), the ID is valid and
 *                 unique.
 *
 *     * node->name: name of this node
 *       node->hash: 31bit hash-value of @name (range [2..INT_MAX-1])
 *                   These values follow the same lifetime rules as node->id.
 *                   They're initialized when the node is linked and then remain
 *                   constant until the last object reference is dropped.
 *                   Unlike the id, the name is only unique across all siblings
 *                   and only until the node is deactivated. Currently, the name
 *                   is even unique if linked but not activated, yet. This might
 *                   change in the future, though. Code should not rely on this.
 *
 *     * node->lock:     lock to protect node->children, node->rb, node->parent
 *     * node->parent: Reference to parent node. This is set during LINK time
 *                     and is dropped during destruction. You must not access
 *                     it unless you hold an active reference to the node or if
 *                     you know the node is dead.
 *     * node->children: rb-tree of all linked children of this node. You must
 *                       not access this directly, but use one of the iterator
 *                       or lookup helpers.

/*
 * Bias values track states of "active references". They're all negative. If a
 * node is active, its active-ref-counter is >=0 and tracks all active
 * references. Once a node is deactivaed, we subtract NODE_BIAS. This means, the
 * counter is now negative but still counts the active references. Once it drops
 * to exactly NODE_BIAS, we know all active references were dropped. Exactly one
 * thread will change it to NODE_RELEASE now, perform cleanup and then put it
 * into NODE_DRAINED. Once drained, all other threads that tried deactivating
 * the node will now be woken up (thus, they wait until the node is fully done).
 * The initial state during node-setup is NODE_NEW. If a node is directly
 * deactivated without having ever been active, it is put into
 * NODE_RELEASE_DIRECT instead of NODE_BIAS. This tracks this one-bit state
 * across node-deactivation. The task putting it into NODE_RELEASE now knows
 * whether the node was active before or not.

 * Some archs implement atomic_sub(v) with atomic_add(-v), so reserve INT_MIN

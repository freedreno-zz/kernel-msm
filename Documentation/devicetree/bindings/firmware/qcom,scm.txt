QCOM Secure Channel Manager (SCM)

Qualcomm processors include an interface to communicate to the secure firmware.
This interface allows for clients to request different types of actions.  These
can include CPU power up/down, HDCP requests, loading of firmware, and other
assorted actions.

Required properties:
- compatible: must contain "qcom,scm"
- clocks: Should contain the core, iface, and bus clocks.
- clock-names: Must contain "core" for the core clock, "iface" for the interface
  clock and "bus" for the bus clock.

Example:

	firmware {
		compatible = "simple-bus";

		scm {
			compatible = "qcom,scm";
			clocks = <&gcc GCC_CE1_CLK> , <&gcc GCC_CE1_AXI_CLK>, <&gcc GCC_CE1_AHB_CLK>;
			clock-names = "core", "bus", "iface";
		};
	};

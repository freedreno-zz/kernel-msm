/*
 * Example: Workers
 * This program computes prime-numbers based on the sieve of Eratosthenes. The
 * master sets up a shared memory region and spawns workers which clear out the
 * non-primes. The master reacts to keyboard input and to client-requests to
 * control what each worker does. Note that this is in no way meant as efficient
 * way to compute primes. It should only serve as example how a master/worker
 * concept can be implemented with kdbus used as control messages.
 *
 * The main process is called the 'master'. It creates a new, private bus which
 * will be used between the master and its workers to communicate. The master
 * then spawns a fixed number of workers. Whenever a worker dies (detected via
 * SIGCHLD), the master spawns a new worker. When done, the master waits for all
 * workers to exit, prints a status report and exits itself.
 *
 * The master process does *not* keep track of its workers. Instead, this
 * example implements a PULL model. That is, the master acquires a well-known
 * name on the bus which each worker uses to request tasks from the master. If
 * there are no more tasks, the master will return an empty task-list, which
 * casues a worker to exit immediately.
 *
 * As tasks can be computationally expensive, we support cancellation. Whenever
 * the master process is interrupted, it will drop its well-known name on the
 * bus. This causes kdbus to broadcast a name-change notification. The workers
 * check for broadcast messages regularly and will exit if they receive one.
 *
 * This example exists of 4 objects:
 *  * master: The master object contains the context of the master process. This
 *            process manages the prime-context, spawns workers and assigns
 *            prime-ranges to each worker to compute.
 *            The master itself does not do any prime-computations itself.
 *  * child:  The child object contains the context of a worker. It inherits the
 *            prime context from its parent (the master) and then creates a new
 *            bus context to request prime-ranges to compute.
 *  * prime:  The "prime" object is used to abstract how we compute primes. When
 *            allocated, it prepares a memory region to hold 1 bit for each
 *            natural number up to a fixed maximum ('MAX_PRIMES').
 *            The memory region is backed by a memfd which we share between
 *            processes. Each worker now gets assigned a range of natural
 *            numbers which it clears multiples of off the memory region. The
 *            master process is responsible of distributing all natural numbers
 *            up to the fixed maximum to its workers.
 *  * bus:    The bus object is an abstraction of the kdbus API. It is pretty
 *            straightfoward and only manages the connection-fd plus the
 *            memory-mapped pool in a single object.
 *
 * This example is in reversed order, which should make it easier to read
 * top-down, but requires some forward-declarations. Just ignore those.
